  <h1> Barely Functional #3 </h1>
  <h2> Tries and Failures </h2>
  <p>Well, time flies! It’s well over a year ago that I promised to continue my writeups on the <code>ethereum-haskell</code> project with some notes on the merkle trie implementation – but it’s been a long time since I’ve had time or inclination to chip at that project, and my notes have been collecting dust.</p>
<p>Since I’d rather not keep that promise alive for another year, here’s the next best thing: <a href="http://ben.kirw.in/merkle-slides/">slides from a presentation I gave to Haskell Montreal last year</a>.</p>
<p>The slides are fairly vanilla haskell, running through a few themes and variations on mapping types in Haskell: association lists, tries, <em>Patricia</em> tries, and then on to Merkle tries and other fancy things. One thing I explore a little bit in the slides, but have never totally fleshed out in real life, is the idea of “abstracting over a reference.” At the end of the day, a Merkle tree is just a regular tree with an unusual reference creation / following procedure – and by abstracting those out, you can write algorithms don’t have to care what type of tree they’re working with at all.</p>
<p>I always feel a little bad throwing slides around on the internet, since they suffer a lot without context – if you have any questions, or you’re just interested in talking about how to write extensions to Pandoc in Haskell, feel free to get in touch!</p>
